# goit-react-hw-02-phonebook

## Task

Write an application for storing phone book contacts.

- The application should consist of a form and a list of contacts. Implement adding the contact name and displaying the contact list. The application should not store contacts between different sessions (page refreshes).
- Each contact must be an object with name and id properties. To generate identifiers, use any appropriate package, for example nanoid.

- Expand the functionality of the application by allowing users to add phone numbers. 
- Add a search field that can be used to filter the list of contacts by name. The filtering logic must be case insensitive.
- Deny the user the ability to add contacts whose names are already in the phone book. When you try to perform such an action, display an alert with a warning.
- Expand the functionality of the application, allowing the user to delete previously saved contacts.
